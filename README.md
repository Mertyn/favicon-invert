# favicon-invert

This is a small webextension concept that can invert all-black website favicons for better visibility on dark browser themes. The extension only inverts the favicons of the URLs listed in the urlList variable. This should certainly be moved to its own config file, but this is only in the concept phase.
I made this addon to demonstrate how something like this might work.
